Node.JS OSC Server
==================

This project is a Node.JS server that forwards messages to an OSC Server
receives messages from OSC Server using `osc4node` and `socket.io`. This
project is meant to serve as a proof-of-concept and example. Maybe in the
future I can package it up if the interest is there.
